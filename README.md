Automatically displays and reads the daily Bible text from jw.org in Home Assistant, with multilingual support and offline access.

## 🗣️ Voice Integration

This project was primarily designed for **Home Assistant Voice** and its native Assist functionality.

While it can technically be used with other voice satellites or TTS systems, this is not the main goal of the project and support for alternative setups may be limited.

## 🌐 Language Support

The user interface is currently available in **English** and **French**.

If you would like to help translate the project into another language, you're welcome to contribute!  
Please feel free to open an issue or start a discussion — we’ll work together to add support for your language.
